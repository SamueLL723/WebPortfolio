            <h3>UFC</h3>
            <small>Posted by Me on 27.11.2025</small>
            <p>
                The UFC, or Ultimate Fighting Championship, is the world's leading professional mixed martial arts (MMA)
                organization, based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Founded in 1993 by Art Davie, Rorion Gracie, and Bob Meyrowitz,
                the UFC was initially conceived as a single-night tournament to determine the most effective martial art
                by pitting fighters from various disciplines—such as boxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and kickboxing—against
                each other with minimal rules. Over time, it evolved from a controversial experimental event into a highly
                organized, sanctioned combat sport and a global sports brand, now producing over 40 live events annually.
                The organization is known for its eight-sided arena, the Octagon, and features fighters across multiple
                weight classes, governed by unified MMA rules, while also serving as a major media content company and the
                largest Pay-Per-View (PPV) event provider in the world.

                Charles Oliveira da Silva, born on October 17, 1989, in the favela of Vicente de Carvalho, Guarujá,
                São Paulo, Brazil, is a Brazilian professional mixed martial artist and fourth-degree black belt in
                Brazilian jiu-jitsu. He is affectionately known as "do Bronxs" and currently competes in the UFC's
                Lightweight division, where he is a former UFC Lightweight Champion. Oliveira holds multiple UFC records,
                including the most submission wins (17), most finishes (21), and most performance bonuses (21) in the
                organization's history. He began training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu at age 12 under Roger Coelho, quickly
                achieving state and international titles before transitioning to MMA in 2007.
